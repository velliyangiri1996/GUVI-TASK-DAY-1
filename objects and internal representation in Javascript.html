    <h2 style="color: red;">Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript</h2>
    <p>Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. <br>
      These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol)<br>
       in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).<br>
<br>
<br>
      Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.<br>
      An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. <br>
      That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.</p>
    
      <h2 style="color: darkblue;">Objects and properties</h2>
      <p> A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object.<br>
         Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. <br>
         The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation like below</p>

         <p>This is way of we create the object and get the object elements </p>
