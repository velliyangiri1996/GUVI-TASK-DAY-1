  <h1 style="color :palevioletred"><b> Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2</b></h1>
  <h2 style="color : red">HTML 1.1 vs HTML 2 </h2>
    <p style="color : blueviolet">HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications.<br>
       More specifically, HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information.<br>
        For instance, when someone navigates to cloudflare.com on their laptop, their web browser sends an<br>
         HTTP request to the Cloudflare servers for the content that appears on the page.<br> 
         Then, Cloudflare servers send HTTP responses with the text, images, and formatting that the browser displays to the user.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color : green">About HTTP 1.1</h2>
    <p style="color :black ">The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of development, <br>
      this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web. In 2015.</p>
    
      <h2 style="color : green">About HTTP 2</h2>
    <p style="color : darkorange" >a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.<br>
        HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. <br>
        In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.<br>
         One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process</p>
        
         <h2 style="color : violet">What is prioritization?</h2>
         <p style="color : blue">In the context of web performance, prioritization refers to the order in which pieces of content are loaded
          Prioritization affects a webpage's load time. For example, certain resources,<br>
             like large JavaScript files, may block the rest of the page from loading if they have to load first.<br> 
            More of the page can load at once if these render-blocking resources load last.</p>

            it blocks all the other resources behind it.</td>

             which often involve several dozen separate resources that the client must request.</td>

          <td>However, HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets.<br> 
            those bytes add up quickly, resulting in faster loading.</td>
